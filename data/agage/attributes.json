    "data_availability_statement": "These data are made available to the scientific community and public to improve understanding of climate change and ozone depletion and to lead to new scientific insights. AGAGE relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to ensure that AGAGE scientists receive fair credit for their work. If the data are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, AGAGE station PIs should be informed at the outset of the proposed work. Station PI contact information is located in the station pages. If the AGAGE data are essential to the work, co-authorship on publications may be appropriate. Manuscripts using the AGAGE data should be sent early to the AGAGE contacts for review before they are submitted for publication, so we can ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately represented. Every effort is made to produce the most accurate and precise measurements possible. However, we reserve the right to make corrections to the data based on recalibration of standard gases or for other reasons deemed scientifically justified. We are not responsible for results and conclusions based on use of these data without regard to this warning. Data used in publications must be included as a supplementary file with the publication.",
    "data_reciprocity_agreement": "Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate. Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their own data available to the general public and to the scientific community in an equally complete and easily accessible form. Scientists are encouraged to make available to the community, upon request, their own modelling tools used in the interpretation of the AGAGE data, namely well documented model code, transport fields, and additional information necessary for other scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.",
    "limit_of_detection_comment": "Data points recorded as zero mole fraction indicate that the mole fraction of a given species within the sample was below the limit of detection for the analyser. They should not be interpreted as implying that the species was not present in the atmosphere.",
    "data_acknowledgements": "Please thank the listed contacts (who are not already co-authors) for each of the stations whose data is used in your paper. Please state: “AGAGE is supported principally by NASA (USA) grants to MIT and SIO, and also by: DESNZ (UK) and NOAA (USA) grants to Bristol University; CSIRO and BoM (Australia): FOEN grants to Empa (Switzerland); NILU (Norway); SNU (Korea); CMA (China); NIES (Japan); and Urbino University (Italy)”.",
